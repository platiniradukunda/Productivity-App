# Productivity App

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technologies used to create app

This project was developed with ReactJS which utilizes HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

## Problem Statement and Solution

This app was created to improve productivity. This app can be used by anyone. To improve productivity, I 
created an app that allows the user to add the number of tasks to that day's agenda. Upon adding the task
to the agenda. The user has an option to start working on the task. On that task's page, the user can set 
a timer for however long they want to work on that task. When the task ends a drumroll will play to indicate
that the time is up so the user doesn't have to keep an eye on the time while they are being productive.

## Bug in app

Before accessing the app, you should know of a little bug. When adding tasks to the agenda, you may have to
refresh the page after clicking the ADD TASK button. This will allow the task to render to the DOM with a start option.
